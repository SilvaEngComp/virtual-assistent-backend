## First steps after clone repository

- To run laravel you need install a PHP version > 7.3, the composer and a database. We are using MYSQL and to make it easy, we are using xampp which provides php and the MYSQL.

### Requiriments softwares

1. Install xampp
2. Install composer

### Start project

- To install base packages you need run the command:

> composer install

### Test if all right

- To test laravel is running well, run the code:

> php artisan serve

- It will return a link of server where service is runing. Access that link and check if a laravel base page is shown. That is it!

### Config database in Heroku

- After define its migrations, to run in Heroku you'll need config a database. We are using Postgre (Heroku Postgre), provided by Herokus for free. This database service has some limitations like:
  - maximum of 10,000 rows
  - 20 connections
  - maximum 10 MB of data
  - orther infos:
